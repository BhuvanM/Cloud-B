A private file storage server.
This project is currently just for some technical learning purposes. 
As is shapes it, we can give some features to it and make it a full fledged project.

Current scope:
A local file server which can be used similar to gdrive to upload and download files. 
Just a command line utility to access the file is expected as of now.
